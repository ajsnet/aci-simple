# aci-simple README.md
The purpose of this project is to provide simplified tools to interact with the Cisco ACI APIC API.

The goal is to provide simplified tools that have extremely simple/minimized requirements that are easy to modify and use.

If you are looking for more comprehensive / advanced tools, the aci-toolkit or ansible Cisco.aci toolsets are more appropriate.

# Scope
I often encounter ACI customers that do not have the need or ability to deploy more comprehensive ACI automation tools.

The tools found here will generally reflect solutions I developed to solve a specific customer need or request.

# Tool
Current list of tools.

- ct2epg - adds contracts as provided/consumed to a given list of EPGs
