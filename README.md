# aci-simple README.md
The purpose of this project is to provide simplified tools to interact with the Cisco ACI APIC API that are easy to modify and use with a minimum of requirements.

If you are looking for comprehensive automation tools, the aci-toolkit or ansible Cisco.aci toolsets are more appropriate.

# Scope
I often encounter ACI customers that do not have the need or ability to deploy more comprehensive ACI automation tools, or where the need for automation revolves around a single one-time automation task such as during a migration.

The tools found here will generally reflect solutions I developed to solve a specific customer need or request and will be added organically.

# Tool
Current list of tools.

- ct2epg - adds contracts as provided/consumed to a given list of EPGs
- apic-stay - [in progress] keep the APIC API logged in indefinitely
